Extra Credit is included in the form of a Timer and an animated Timer Bar.
The length of the Bar decreases as time passes.
The color of the Bar changes as time passes.

Upon loading the page, a random topic is picked.
The only choice is to take the quiz.
By clicking that button, the first question is randomly picked.
If the timer runs out, the answer is assumed to be wrong and the next question is displayed.
The score updates after each new question.

Once the user clicks an answer, the correctness of that answer, along with an explanation for the correct answer, is displayed.
The next button is highlighted for ease of use.

At any time, the user may quit the quiz.
Upon doing so, the total score thus far is shown.
In addition, an option to restart a new quiz is given.

Once the user finishes a page, the score of the quiz is provided.
